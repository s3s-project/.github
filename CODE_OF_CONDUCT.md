# Code of Conduct

All repositories under <https://github.com/s3s-project> follow the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

**Additional**: Content focused on *real‑world politics* is considered off-topic and may be moderated. Technical, legal, or policy discussions that are directly relevant to the project's development and operation are allowed.

## Enforcement

If you have concerns about a violation of the code of conduct, please report it to the repository maintainers.

- **Preferred**: Use GitHub's built-in **"Report content"** feature on the specific issue, pull request, or comment.
- Alternative: Contact maintainers privately (for example, via a private email).
- If the issue is already public and you feel safe doing so: mention maintainers in the relevant thread to request moderator attention.

The maintainers will review the report and take appropriate action, which may include:
- A private or public warning.
- Hiding or deleting relevant content.
- A temporary ban or permanent ban from the repository or organization.

## Languages

All repositories under <https://github.com/s3s-project> use the following languages by default.

- English — primary language
- Chinese (Simplified) — secondary language

We accept these languages in documents, code comments, issues, pull requests, discussions, and other meaningful places.

If possible, please include an English summary when writing in non-primary languages to help a wider audience participate.
